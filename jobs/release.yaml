          description: |
            Input the current bundle revision associated with the stable branch.
            The downstream repos will then be tagged with that bundle revision
            so that fixes can still be applied to our currently supported
            releases.

            Input the current stable Kubernetes release, for example, if
            releasing a new minor of 1.16 then this parameter would be set to

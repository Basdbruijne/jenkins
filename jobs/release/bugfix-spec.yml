    ## Bugfix Release Process

    ### Cherry-pick fixes from master into stable branches

    ### Document release notes

    - Bugfixes
    - Enhancements
    - Known Limitations/Issues

    ### Tag existing stable branches with bugfix release tag

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/sync-stable-tag-bundle-rev/

    ### Run the **build-charms** job

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/build-charms/

    This will build and promote the stable charms to candidate channel for testing.

    #### Charm build options

    ### Promote charms from **candidate** to **stable**

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/promote-charms/

    This job takes a tag, from_channel, and to_channel. The tag defaults to `k8s` so
    it will only promote the necessary charms that make up charmed-kuberneetes (the
    others are kubeflow related).

    ### Promote bundles from **candidate** to **stable**

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/promote-bundles/

    Same as charm promotion.

    ### Send announcement to k8s-crew with any relevant information.

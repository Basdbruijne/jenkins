    Outlines the processes for publishing a new Charmed Kubernetes release.

    ## Stable Release Process

    ### How to read this document

    Each step in the release process contains information pertaining to the
    description of the jobs and what is required if needing to run the jobs
    locally.

    Each step should contain the following:

    - Job name as seen in jenkins
    - Requirements to run the job including what environment variables need to be set
    - Example of running the OGC specification within tox.

    ### Tag existing stable branches with the current stable bundle

    For all charm repos that make up CK tag the existing stable branches with
    the most recently released stable bundle revision.

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/sync-stable-tag-bundle-rev/

    ### Submit PR's to bundle and charms to pin snap version on the stable branches

    We need to make sure that the bundle fragments and kubernetes-worker/master/e2e
    are set to `<k8sver>/stable` prior to cutting a new release.

    > Note: The charms themselves also need to be done as some do not use our
      bundles for deployment.

    ### Rebase stable on top of master git branches

    Once all repositories are tagged we need to rebase what's in master git on
    to stable as this will be our snapshot on what we test and subsequently
    promote to stable.

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/cut-stable-release/

    ### Bump snap version to next minor release

    Once the rebase has occurred we need to bump the charms and bundle fragments
    to the next k8s minor version, ie 1.17/edge.

    ### Build new CK Charms from stable git branches

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/build-charms/

    Pull down all layers and checkout their stable branches. From there build
    each charm against those local branches. After the charms are built they need to be
    promoted to the **beta** channel in the charmstore.

    >-
      **Note**: Beta channel is required as any bugfix releases happening at the
      same time will use the candidate channels for staging those releases.

    #### Charm build options

    ![charm build options](build-charms-options.png)

    ### Promote new K8S snaps

    Promote new K8S snaps for the upcoming stable release to the beta and
    candidate channels of the snapstore.

    > **Info**: Please note that currently **CDK-ADDONS** snap needs to be
        manually promoted to the appropriate channels.

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/build-snaps/

    #### Snap build options

    ![snap build options](build-snaps-options.png)

    ### Validate Charmed Kubernetes

    With all bits in place, time to validate CK.

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/validate-minor-release/

    ### CNCF Conformance

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/conformance/

    ### Notify Solutions QA

    Notify solutions-qa that CK is ready to be run through their tests. Once
    that is complete and relayed to us, we can start the release to stable.

    ### Document release notes

    - Bugfixes
    - Enhancements
    - Known Limitations/Issues

    ### Promote charms from **beta** to **stable**

    This job takes a tag, from_channel, and to_channel. The tag defaults to `k8s` so
    it will only promote the necessary charms that make up charmed-kuberneetes (the
    others are kubeflow related).

    _Jenkins Job_: promote-charms

    _Requirements_:

    **Environment Variables**:

    - TOX_WORK_DIR=~/.tox
    - FROM_CHANNEL=beta
    - TO_CHANNEL=stable
    - CHARM_LIST=jobs/includes/charm-support-matrix.inc
    - FILTER_BY_TAG=k8s


    _Example_:

    ```
    tox -e py36 -- ogc jobs/build-charms/spec.yml -t promote-charms
    ```

    ### Promote bundles from **beta** to **stable**

    Same as charm promotion.

    _Jenkins Job_: promote-bundles

    _Requirements_:

    **Environment Variables**:

    - TOX_WORK_DIR=~/.tox
    - FROM_CHANNEL=beta
    - TO_CHANNEL=stable
    - CHARM_LIST=jobs/includes/charm-support-matrix.inc
    - FILTER_BY_TAG=k8s


    _Example_:

    ```
    tox -e py36 -- ogc jobs/build-charms/spec.yml -t promote-bundles
    ```

    ### Send announcement

    Email annoucement to k8s-crew with any relevant information.

    ### Update ck bundle repo references

    Update ck bundle repo to match the current stable snap release and point the
    latest to the next minor version.

    For example, if 1.16 is the upcoming release, then once CK is released we
    need to update the bundle repo stable branch to reflect 1.16/stable. Also,
    update the master branch to point to the next K8S release, in this case
    1.17/edge.
